# Drone
The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for windows-based systems. Drone draws its inspiration from virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows, and Siri for 
iOS. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with 
the assistant  through voice commands. 
As a personal assistant, Jarvis assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, geeting users according to the time and date ,
searching queries in google, searching for videos, retrieving images, live weather conditions, word meanings, searching for medicine details,fetching daily news, 
sending whatsapp messages and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks.
Drone is initialised by a face recognition system .
